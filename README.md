# My-own-game

story:
This game is about a cat and a dog, and the players have to make sure that their character (either the cat or the dog) collects the food, toys and other objects, and dodges the obstacles, such as the big scary dog and the animal control people, while they are strolling down the road/footpath. If the animal collects the right objects then their point will buld up and so will their name on the leaderboard, but if they collide with an obstacle they lose a life, and once they run out of all three lifes, they will get an alert saying game over.

Goal:
To get points by making the character collect the food, and whoever get's the most points by collecting items will be higher in the leader board. The other thing is that the winner is determined based on the number of points they have by the time that they reach the end.

PC:
Cat and Dog.
NPC: the obstacles and the food
